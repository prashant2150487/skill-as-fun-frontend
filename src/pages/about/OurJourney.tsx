                    SkillAsFun began in 2024 when three passionate educatorsâ€”
                    Prashant Sachan, Arpan Sachan, and Mahesh Kumar frustrated
                    with the limitations of existing educational technology.
                    They saw firsthand how technology could transform learning
                    when designed with real classroom needs in mind, but too
                    often, the available tools fell short.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                    What started as a small project to create better assessment
                    tools for their own classrooms quickly gained attention from
                    colleagues and administrators. Encouraged by the positive
                    feedback and seeing the impact on student engagement and
                    outcomes, the trio decided to formalize their efforts and
                    founded SkillAsFun.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                    In our first year, we launched our flagship learning
                    management system, SkillAsFun, which was adopted by 12
                    schools in our local district. By year three, we had
                    expanded our product line to include adaptive learning
                    tools, virtual science labs, and a comprehensive analytics
                    platform for educators.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                    Today, SkillAsFun serves over 5 educational institutions
                    across 1 countries, with a team of 10 dedicated
                    professionals who share our founding vision: that
                    technology, when thoughtfully designed and implemented, can
                    transform education for the better.
